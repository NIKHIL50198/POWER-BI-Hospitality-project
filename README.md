Problem Statement
Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.

Learnt things from this Project
1) By referring different cancellation polices followed by different hotels, understood that most of the hotels charge zero fee, only if the booking is cancelled before three months of booking date. If the booking is cancelled after that, the charge range from 60 to 90% of the booking cost.

2) Learnt, how to use bookmarks and selection for different purposes. (Page navigation and clear filter button in the dashboard was achieved using bookmarks and selection. website like page navigation YouTube tutorial )

3)Tried using color palette and stick with that colors throughout the dashboard
