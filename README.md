Problem Statement
Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.

Learnt things from this Project

▪ By analysing different hotel cancellation policies, understood that most hotels charge zero fee only if a booking is cancelled within three months of the booking date, while cancellations after that are charged 60–90% of the total booking cost.

▪ Learnt to use Bookmarks and Selection Pane in Power BI for achieving page navigation and clear filter buttons, giving the dashboard a smooth, website-like navigation experience.

▪ Used a consistent color palette throughout the dashboard for a clean, cohesive, and professional visual experience.

▪ AtliQ earned ₹1.7 Billion in total revenue during the analysis period, with an Average Daily Rate (ADR) of ₹12.7K, but the occupancy rate stood at only 57.9%, meaning nearly half the rooms remained unsold on average.

▪ The realisation rate (actual revenue collected vs. potential revenue) was 70.1%, indicating a significant gap due to cancellations and no-shows.

▪ Mumbai emerged as the top-performing city with ₹669M revenue, followed by Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Delhi, while Delhi recorded the lowest revenue (₹294M) despite strong guest ratings (4.25) and high occupancy, suggesting low visibility or poor marketing efforts.

▪ Bangalore properties generated high revenue but had very low average ratings (2.36), indicating potential issues with guest satisfaction that could harm brand reputation in the long run.

▪ AtliQ Exotica outperformed all properties with ₹320M revenue, 3.62 rating, 57% occupancy, and a 24.4% cancellation rate.

▪ AtliQ Bay achieved the highest occupancy (66%), while Week 24 recorded the highest weekly revenue (₹139.6M).

▪ AtliQ Seasons contributed only ₹66M in revenue, making it one of the least performing properties.

▪ The company lost nearly ₹299M in revenue due to a 24.8% cancellation rate, consistent across major cities like Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Delhi.

▪ Elite-type rooms recorded the highest bookings and revenue but also showed the highest cancellation rate, while Presidential rooms underperformed despite being premium offerings.

▪ Most bookings and revenue came through third-party platforms such as Makemytrip and Others, whereas direct bookings were very low — leading to higher commission costs and less control over customer relationships.

▪ Across cities, Delhi led in occupancy and rating, followed by Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Bangalore.




Recommendations & Actionable Suggestions

▪ Improve Direct Bookings:
Encourage customers to book directly through AtliQ’s website or app by offering loyalty points, discounts, or special perks. This will reduce third-party commissions and improve profit margins.

▪ Address Cancellations:
Introduce flexible yet structured cancellation and refund policies, require advance deposits, and send reminder notifications before check-in to reduce last-minute cancellations.

▪ Boost Marketing in Delhi:
Despite high ratings and occupancy, Delhi’s revenue is low — this suggests poor visibility. Run targeted digital marketing campaigns, optimize SEO for Delhi properties, and promote them on Google Hotels & OTA platforms.

▪ Enhance Guest Experience in Bangalore:
Low ratings in Bangalore signal service quality issues. Conduct staff training, improve cleanliness, communication, and amenities, and actively collect guest feedback to improve reputation.

▪ Optimize Pricing Strategy:
Revisit ADR (Average Daily Rate) and apply dynamic pricing based on demand, seasonality, and competitor pricing to balance occupancy and revenue.

▪ Focus on Underperforming Properties:
Properties like AtliQ Seasons should be reviewed for location, pricing, or operational inefficiencies. Consider rebranding, renovation, or marketing push to boost performance.

▪ Leverage Data Insights for Forecasting:
Use the dashboard insights to build predictive models for revenue forecasting and cancellation prediction — helping management take proactive decisions.

▪ Retention through Loyalty Programs:
Launch an AtliQ Loyalty Program offering reward points, free upgrades, or special discounts to repeat customers to increase retention and direct sales.

▪ Optimize Room Mix:
Since Elite rooms generate the most bookings but also high cancellations, review their pricing and booking terms. Also, promote Presidential rooms through bundled offers or premium experiences to increase demand.

▪ Enhance Week 24 Learnings:
Analyse what led to Week 24’s peak revenue (₹139.6M) — whether it was a festival, event, or promotion — and replicate similar strategies in other weeks.
